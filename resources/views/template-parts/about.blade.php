            <p class="about-text text-justify">
            I am a fourth-generation Californian, born in San Francisco, adopted, and raised by my parents in the Sierra foothills. I spent my early years exploring the world, cultivating meaningful relationships, and gathering skills that would prepare me for the adventure of a lifetime. In 1994, I completed a solo winter expedition across Alaska which I filmed for National Geographic. 
         </p>
            <p class="about-text text-justify">
            For the last 16 years, my focus has been on building up and investing in my hometown of Nevada City, California to be a more successful and resilient community.    
         </p>
            <p class="about-text text-justify">
            I am now fighting for you and the next seven generations of California by resurrecting values that protect children and our golden state.
